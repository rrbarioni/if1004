### Reading the article "Facts, trends and challenges in modern software development‚Äù and correlated the 10 adages in CD (from HW 1.4) with these facts, trends and challenges.

## 1. Every Feature Is an Experiment
Collaborative development, by making use of users for testing and providing bug reports and elucidation of new features.

It is also correlated with mobile trends, where there are challenges to create features in accordance to mobile devices constraints, such as its limited resources and interfaces.

## 2. The Cost of Change Is Dead
The idea here is to perform fast testing cycles, in order to active users participate in the quality assurance process, so that the encounter of new bugs are as fast as possible, lowering its cost to be repaired.

## 3. Be Fast to Deploy but Slow (or Slower) to Release
Collaborative development; it is possible to use services like Github, Google Code and Jazz.net in order to release new software versions while keeping track on developing new features.

## 4. Invest for Survival
Collaborative development, where it is important to automate test suites, so that developers are aware of what is to be done.

## 5. You Are the Support Person
Collaborative development; it is necessary to have a quality assurance (QA), in order to enable the participation of users in development process.

## 6. Configuration Is Code
Cloud computing trend; when a feature is developed, it must work as well as if it was deployed in a bigger scale.

## 7. Comfort the Customer with Discomfort
It is important to understand users' contexts and design changes gradually, so that users don't have to wait too long for new updates.

## 8. Looking Back to Move Forward
In order to keep performing new continuous deployments, it is important to understand what kind of failures were performed in previous cycles, so that developers are aware of not repeating mistakes.

## 9. Invite Privacy and Security In
In cloud computing, this is one of the main challenges; as application's data are stored in external servers, security measures must be taken into account, in order to keep sensitive data safe.

## 10. Ready or Not, Here It Comes
It is important to perform DevOps practices like continuous integration, automated testing and validation practices, in order to deliver features to costumers and be not behind the competitors.
